## cconnectt project description
- the project is made for influencers and content creators, influencers to easily colaborate with the best brands out there be it hotels, shops , fashion brands or even a gaming company. 
- the idea of the project is to make the whole process of influencing more easy and transparent. so to do that we have writter a spil dcontrat using which the influencers and the brand can easily colaborate on a prefixed percentage of all shares made using the smart contract that will be generated.
- we are also creating a QR for the contract so that it can easlily be scanned and then payments can be made.
- we also have the feature of colaborating with NFT collection where the influencers can launch their NFT drop along with the previous payment splitter functions. 
- main features of these include the option to keep a limited or unlimited drop. 
- for not the minimum amount toi recieve a NFT is set to 100 SHM but that can be easily changed so anyone who makes a payment of more than the base amoount will be issued a NFT from the collection .
-  there is also the function of keeping it usique meaning that the influencer may decide that if one address can own more than one NFT of a gioven collection .
- We have also integrated the product with lighthouse to use the access control to release a exclusive video/ file to anyone who is the owner of a nft from our collection. 

- the platform has all the listed featurs implemented.


## Getting Started 

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template cra-javascript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `src/index.js`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for our [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.

### Deploy to IPFS

Deploy a copy of your application to IPFS using the following command:

```bash
